# ML-Associsation-Learning-Rule
Association rule learning is a prominent and a well-explored method for determining relations among variables in large databases.
Let I={i1,i2,i3,…,in} be a set of n attributes called items and D={t1,t2,…,tn} be the set of transactions. It is called database. Every transaction, ti in D has a unique transaction ID, and it consists of a subset of itemsets in I.
A rule can be defined as an implication, X⟶Y where X and Y are subsets of I(X,Y⊆I), and they have no element in common, i.e., X∩Y. X and Y are the antecedent and the consequent of the rule, respectively.
